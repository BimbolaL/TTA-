 <!-- Select one or more choices from the list of common Machine Learning Algorithms, do some investigations and write me a short summary. I am looking for the following:
Algorithms, do some investigations and write me a short summary. I am looking for the following:
• Is it Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement learning?
• What does the algorithm do?
• In which situations will it be most useful?
• (Optional) Can you find any examples of where this
algorithm has been used? -->

  *************************DECISION TREE**************************************************************
  Decison tree is the most easiest common used classification algorithm to understand and interprete data.  which is the type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for solving classification and regression problem used .
  Decison algorithm  aim to create training model  that can be used to predict the class label or value in does works for categorical and continuous variable
  Desion Algorithms most useful in when spliting poplation into two or more set in distring two groups
situtaion decisoin  is used in predicting decrite and continouse value.  value 1,0, true or false, email spam or not spam, home price

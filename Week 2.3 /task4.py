# •Write a program which will ask for two numbers from a user. Then offer an option menu to the user giving them a choice of Math’s operators. Once the user has selected which operator they wish to use, perform the calculation by using a procedure and passing parameters. 


def calculate_1():
    add = int(input("x + y"))
    module = int(input("x / y"))
    multiply = int(input("x * y"))
    sub = int(input("x - y"))

    print ("The sun of two nums is equal to " + add)

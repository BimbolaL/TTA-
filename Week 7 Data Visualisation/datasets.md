 I chose this favorite  books so the, looking at kaggle and tableau dataset i find it hard to pick a real life dataset using the machine learning concept that i have learnt.  i couldnt find a a single tasked based that relate to me so i decieded to make one myself, african favorite books. i just use this to practices a new skills. 

I USED DATA visualization which is for representing data or information in a graph ,chart or visual formation. in this case i use excel to create the data and imported it to tableau. generating the data on excel was quickly a easy and less stresful.
